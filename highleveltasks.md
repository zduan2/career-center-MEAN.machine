#Project Milestones

##Release 0.1 (July 13)

On July 13, you must present an initial overview of the project to your classmates. This will include crafting an initial README.md file, identifying the high level tasks to be completed this semester, and preparing paper mockups or digital prototypes to communicate the design goals. The README file and prototypes should be committed to a GitHub repository, and the tasks should be entered into a waffle.io (or similar tool) task board. You will give a 10 minute presentation to your classmates.

##Release 0.2 (July 20)

By July 20, you are to have set up the "technology stack" for your project and integrated all the moving parts, so that it is possible to begin adding features.

For example, if you are creating a PHP/MySQL based website, you need to have set up the database and some of its tables, established a web hosting account, decided on a PHP version, and created at least one basic "Hello, World" page with links to a basic CSS file. Determining a folder structure, and perhaps creating dummy files for pages yet to be developed, are also good ideas. Commit the current version of your code to the GitHub repository.

This step is vital because it makes it possible to test and demonstrate new features. With the technology stack in place, someone could make a change to the CSS (or something) and test it with all the other components working. For full credit, you also need to provide a set of instructions and documentation for others to use your software. I, or anyone else, should be able to follow these instructions to get your project up and running, or perhaps even fork our own version and build of your software. Therefore, in addition to your code, you need to provide information about how your server is set up, and you'll probably need to provide the SQL scripts to set up your database. A sign of good design is that the list of instructions doesn't need to be too long!

Finally, in your presentation to the class, point out areas where you'd like classmates to help.

##Release 0.3 (July 28)

At this time, you should have some working features of your project coded. I suggest you start with the core feature -- the one most important to the users -- and try not to get bogged down with login/logout or basic CRUD stuff, which can distract you for a long time.

Carry out some "user testing" with at least 3 people (ideally, with intended customers or end users) to get some feedback on the usability of your software. You might want to video their experiences with your product. In your presentation to the class, tell us some of the feedback they gave you, and show us at least one specific change you have made as a result of this testing.

##Release 0.4 (August 3)

By now your software should be substantially complete. This is the time to get as many less-important features done as possible, and let your client know which features probably won't get done in this semester. The client should be involved in determining these priorities and helping you decide what to include and what to defer. You may want to start removing links to pages that aren't going to be finished, and generally polishing the details.

In your presentation to the class, show us the new features you have built, and convince the professor that you will be ready to "go live" in two weeks. This is also a good time to make a final appeal for help from classmates.

##Release 1.0 (August 10)

Give a public demonstration and presentation about your completed project. Normally, this is conducted as an "expo" for other students, faculty, staff, and friends of the Information Systems department to see your projects. I may very well invite some of these people to attend and observe your final presentations, so anticipate that. You should be prepared to give a quality brief demonstration, and answer questions about:

    How the project evolved and changed during the course of development
    What's the path going forward for this project, and what you might have done if you had had extra time

I'll invite your clients/sponsors to the showcase as well, and after this event I'll give them a questionnaire to provide feedback that impacts your grade. So give it a good effort!

##Project Report (August 10)

Prepare a report of at least 20 pages that tells the story of your successful project. At a minimum, it should include the following:

    Title page, table of contents, and 1-page summary
    Identify the client, the problem, and the proposed solution
    Identify the team members
    Give an overview of functionality, actual and planned
    Describe the technology stack and any info needed to understand the code
    Describe your testing and evaluation activities and findings
    Tell us what's next for the software. Did it go live? Will it be developed further?

Feel free to embellish the report with graphics, code documentation, usage instructions, and other valuable information. A major objective here is to have a "success story" that you can add to your portfolio and that I can share with Dr. Joe Clark for future semesters as well as other potential capstone project clients.
